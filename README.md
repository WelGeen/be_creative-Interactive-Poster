## 🧪 What is this?

This project is an **interactive poster** using **Google's MediaPipe** framework for **hand tracking**, some rain effects, and a splash of creativity.

We created this to explore how motion and interaction can attract attention — and more importantly — invite students to join our **Creative Coding Workshops**!

## 📸 How to use

1. **Borrow a webcam** and place it carefully *on top of the screen*.
2. **Plug it into your laptop** and connect the laptop to the big screen.
3. Make sure you're using a **Windows machine** and that the **external screen is set as the main display**.
4. Open the v2 demo in Chrome or Edge.
5. Enjoy the interaction — your hand will trigger playful rain and effects on screen!

## 🎯 Purpose

This isn't just a fun demo — it's a **live invitation**. The poster is meant to catch attention and spark curiosity about our creative coding approach.

We hope it inspires students to experiment, remix, cut and paste, and build something even better.
